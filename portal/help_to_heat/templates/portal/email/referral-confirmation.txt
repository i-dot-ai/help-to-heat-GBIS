Hi,

Your details have been submitted to {{supplier_name}}.

# What happens next?

We have sent your referral to the energy supplier you selected. They will contact you within X working days to confirm they have received your referral or to ask you for more information.

You do not need to create another referral at any point.

Once the energy supplier has confirmed they have received your referral, they will review your referral and determine whether your property is applicable for home improvements. They may ask you for more information. You will be notified of the outcome of the review process.

Properties that are applicable for home improvements must have a home survey completed. Your energy supplier will organise this with you.
